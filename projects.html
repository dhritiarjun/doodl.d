                        The thesis aims to assess and evaluate existing machine learning methods such as sentiment analysis and image-based forecasting in fashion trend predictions.
                        The end goal is to generate a novel ML model  for better trend prediction in fashion retailing
                        Approaches used:
                        Fashion trend forecasting systems using techniques like R-CNNs, logistic regression, multivariate attention fusion in addition to other techniques.
